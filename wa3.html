<p>The r/WallStreetBets short squeeze phenomenon has left regulators, investors, and platform decision-makers wondering what kind of next steps they should take. Robinhood, the popular investing app made the decision to heavily restrict the purchasing of GME shares, citing ‘market volatility’. When many discovered that Robinhood sells their user’s data to for-profit financial organizations, possibly creating a conflict of interest, many expressed outrage. This situation raises interesting questions: what kind of responsibilities do online platforms have regarding their users? Do these companies have legal obligations to protect their user’s data? Moral obligations?<p>

<p>In the digital age, data produced by humans is one of the most valuable commodities that can be bought and sold. Many businesses operate solely to buy and sell user data. Robinhood, for example, makes millions of dollars selling its user’s positions to market research firms and other financial organizations.
According to a pew research study from 2019, about half of Americans believe they have no control over which companies and organizations are able to access their online searches and search history. This sentiment is largely correct. While it is true there are solutions that people can use to increase their online privacy, most do not use these solutions. According to the same Pew research study, 79% of adults expressed concern about the ways in which companies are using their data that is collected.<p>

<p>Do those 79% of adults surveyed have a right to be concerned? Surely there must be some sort of regulatory enforcement that prevents private companies from misusing our data, right? Not really. Compared to other democratic countries, the United States has barely any regulatory posture on data privacy.

  The United States currently has 3 data privacy laws for specific types of personal data:
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule" target="_blank">The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a> protects personal information of children under the age of 12. Sorry, 13 year olds...</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html" target="_blank">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a> requires companies to safeguard American’s personal health information, but there is rampant noncompliance.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act" target="_blank">The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> sort of protects financial information, but barely.</li>
</ol>
  That’s pretty much it. There is no federal standard that requires companies to even try to maintain American’s privacy in regards to their data. In the eyes of the United States federal government, your data can be bought, sold, and transferred all around the world for purposes totally unrelated to the original reason the data was collected. So what kinds of legal obligations do companies have to protect their users and their data? What kind of due diligence must companies take to protect the privacy of their users? Basically none. Although some states have begun taking it upon themselves to enact minor data privacy laws.<p>

<p>What about moral obligations? Morality is highly subjective, and in this case pretty much irrelevant. The companies that collect and sell your data do not have any incentive to respect your privacy. Their incentive is to earn money.<p>

<p>In capitalist economies, when private entities’ incentive to earn money is counterproductive to a public virtue and the market does not correct the incentive, public policy should be enacted to protect individual consumers. In 2016, the European Union enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Until a similar regulation is enacted in the United States, companies and organizations will continue misusing American’s data, and we will continue seeing more instances of misaligned incentives and conflicts of interest.<p>
