<h1 id="Header">Bootstrap Redesign Features</h1>



</body>

<p>I essentially redesigned the entire aesthetic of the site, and almost everything about the way in which the site actually functions.</p>

<h3 class = "b">Home Page</h3>

<p>The home page was changed dramatically. I removed the corny greeting, and instead decided to highlight my projects on the main page. My projects are presented in a neat little grid, using the bootstrap class: "col-sm-3" This class is how my projects and the links are kept in a grid display. Here's the documentaion for this class, which also displays how the class looks in-site: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/  I also have the class "container-fluid bg-3 text-center" which resizes the items in the grid. </p>

<h3 class = "b">About Me</h3>
<p>I added a few things to the about page. I now have my education and skills listed for anyone that is potentially interested. I also put a bootstrap footer at the bottom of the page</p>

<h3 class = "b">Contact Page</h3>
<p>the actual content on my contact page is identical, but I redesigned to fit the aesthetic of the rest of the site. I also put a bootstrap footer at the bottom of the page</p>

<h3 class = "b">Portfolio Page</h3>
<p>I no longer have a portfolio page. Instead, I chose to host all my projects up front on the home page. Having a home page with nothing but a picture and a greeting felt a bit pointless.</p>

<h3 class = "b">link to old site</h3>
<a href="oldsite.html" target="_blank">Link to old site</a> </p>
